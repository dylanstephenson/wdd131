                Since I have very limited stovetop space, I find myself making rice in the instant pot very often while I have other parts 
                of my meal cooking on the stove or in the oven. I've found so many different recipes online and have tried them with varying
                results. My favorite ways to do rice in the instant pot are as follows. 
            <p></p>
            <ul class="tip-list">
                <li>For long grain white rice, do 1 1/2 cups water for every 1 cup of rice, 3 minutes pressure cooking on high with 7 minutes of natural release. You can add 2 Tbsp to add a yummy flavor and texture.</li>
                <li>For jasmine rice, the ratio is 1 cup water for every 1 cup rice. Pressure cook 4 minutes with 10 minutes natural release. Jasmine rice is my current favorite as it tastes like a blend of sticky rice and fluffy white rice.</li>
                <li>For brown rice, it's 1 1/2 cup water for 1 cup rice. Pressure cook for 15 minutes with 5 minutes of natural release. Instant pot brown rice is awesome since you don't have to leave it on the stove for an hour.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="tip-h3">Cooking Chicken</h3>

                I still have a lot to learn when it comes to cooking chicken, but I'm definitely a lot more comfortable with it than I was when
                I started. Some of these tips may be things you're well aware of, but hopefully something on this list can help you! Most of these have to do with
                cooking in a pan on a stove, since my oven is very small and I don't own a grill.
            </p>
            <ul class="tip-list">
                <li>If you struggle getting your chicken crisp with a nice golden color, there's a few things that could becausing that. These are things that helped me consistently get a good color and texture on my chicken.</li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Make sure the chicken has room to cook in the pan. If you have too much chicken cooking all at once, the moisture from the chicken starts to crowd the pan, and you end up with a boiled chicken texture and lose a lot of flavor.</li>
                    <li>Pat dry chicken before cooking. Removing as much moisture as possible before cooking and seasoning with salt and pepper I've found helps the outside crisp up quickly</li>
                    <li>Use a generous amount of oil or butter. My sister is one of the best I know of at pan-frying chicken, and the trick she taught me is to cook chicken in butter, and to keep adding in butter while it's cooking. This makes the chicken super flavorful and juicy on the inside while crisping on the outside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Want shredded chicken but don't have time to slow cook in a crock pot? Here are a couple of ways you can quickly make shreddable chicken.</li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Cook chicken breast on one side in pan for 5 minutes or until it gets a nice golden color. Flip the chicken breast, add at least 2 cups of broth, and then cover and cook until chicken is fully cooked, about 6-8 minutes. When it comes out, it's easily shreddable and stays pretty juicy.</li>
                    <li>Pressure cooked chicken breast is also easily shreddable. Pressure cook thawed chicken for about 6 minutes. If frozen, cook for 9 minutes or more. Natural release time not is not needed for this. Make sure to add plenty of broth to the pressure cooker so the chicken doesn't burn. When shredding, add the broth back to the chicken to keep it from tasting dry.</li>
                    <li>Fun side note - If you have a lot of chicken to shred and you want to get it done quickly, you can use a handmixer instead of forks to shred. I do it all the time and it's really awesome how quickly it all shreds!</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Here are some fun, quick, breading techniques for when you want to add a bit of texture and flavor to your chicken.</li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Most of the time, I dip chicken in flour with salt added, then into a whisked egg mixture, and then finish with panko breadcrumbs mixed with seasoning. If you have a food processor, adding blended nuts also mixes really well with the panko breadcrumbs. This can be baked in oven or cooked in lots of oil on the stove</li>
                    <li>When I'm making breaded chicken for more asian recipes, I go more basic. I dip chicken into whisked egg mixture, and then into flour, and then cook in very hot oil. Once cooked, I put it in a bowl and mix with teriyaki, orange sauce, or whatever I think will go well with the recipe.</li>
                    <li>Don't have time to do normal breading for the chicken but still want a slightly breaded taste? Just dip the chicken in flour and seasoning before throwing it in the pan. It sounds simple, but it does add a unique texture to the chicken that I really enjoy.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="tip-h3">Final Tip -- Experiment with all of your recipes!</h3>
            <p class="tip-p">
                I know this isn't as specific as my last two tips, but I do think keeping this in mind helps in the long run. It's very normal
                to have a handful of recipes that you're really comfortable with that you know how to make from memory. I have acquired a few of these 
                myself and I've recently been trying to do things different, whether I add or take away some ingredients, season things differently, or 
                use a different meat or grain. 
            </p>
            <p class="tip-p">
                For example, my wife and I make the instant pot jambalaya recipe all of the time. In the recipe, when you add the diced tomatoes, you are supposed to
                add it with all of the juices. My wife started having a bad reaction to how tomato-y the jambalaya was, so the next time I made it I drained and rinsed the diced
                tomatoes before adding them to the pot. I ended up with a dish that had pretty much all the same ingredients, but tasted very different. I honestly didn't realize
                how much the tomato juice was drowning out the other flavors of the peppers, seasoning, celery, onions, and all of the other elements in the dish. One small change
                ended up totally changing the flavor, and now we enjoy this dish even more than we used to. So, change things up! Just a small difference might impact a dish in a way
                that makes you love it even more!
